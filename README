NSSOreaddata

Scripts provided here can be used to read National Sample Survey
Organisation's unit-level data from various surveys. The scripts
output csv tables. In future, the scripts will be modified to directly
create MySQL/POSTGRESQL database tables.

NSSO unit-level data are not provided along with the scripts. These
have to be obtained independently from NSSO
(http://mospi.gov.in/nsso_4aug2008/web/nsso/Unitdata.htm).

Scripts are provided under GNU/GPL (V3.0 or higher) license.
